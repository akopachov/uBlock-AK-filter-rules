# uBlock filter rules
In this repo I keep all custom filter rules I'm using for the sites I'm typically visiting. Some of them are trying to "mask" ad or make it "native". But this is not what I want to see.
As for now there are rules for:
* tut.by
* talks.by
* music.yandex.ru
* pikabu.ru
* yaplakal.com
* habrahabr.ru
* geektimes.ru
* drive2.ru

#### Any reasonable pull requests \ suggestions are welcome!
