# uBlock filter rules
In this repo I'm keeping all custom filter rules I'm using for the sites I'm typically visit. Some of them are trying to "mask" ad or make it "native". But this is not what I want to see.
As for now there are rules for:
* tut.by
* talks.by
* music.yandex.ru
* pikabu.ru
* yaplakal.com
* habrahabr.ru
* geektimes.ru

#### Any reasonable pull requests \ suggestions are welcome!
